                    <h4>What is BDS?</h4>
                    <p>
                      Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) is a Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality.
                      BDS upholds the simple principle that Palestinians are entitled to the same rights as the rest of humanity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Inspired by the South African anti-apartheid movement, the Palestinian BDS call urges
                      nonviolent pressure on Israel until it complies with international law by meeting three demands:
                    </p>

                    <h6>Ending its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall</h6>
                    <p>
                      International law recognizes the West Bank including East Jerusalem, Gaza and the Syrian Golan Heights
                      as occupied by Israel. As part of its military occupation, Israel steals land and forces Palestinians
                      into ghettos, surrounded by checkpoints, settlements and watchtowers and an illegal apartheid Wall.
                      Israel has imposed a medieval siege on Gaza, turning it into the largest open air prison in the world.
                      Israel also regularly carries out large-scale assaults on Gaza that are widely condemned as constituting
                      war crimes and crimes against humanity.
                    </p>


                    <h6>Recognizing the fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality</h6>
                    <p>
                      One-fifth of Israelâ€™s citizens are Palestinians who remained inside the armistice lines after 1948.
                      They are subjected to a system of racial discrimination enshrined in more than 50 laws that impact every
                      aspect of their lives. The Israeli government continues to forcibly displace Palestinian communities in Israel
                      from their land. Israeli leaders routinely and openly incite racial violence against them.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN Resolution 194</h6>
                    <p>
                      Since its violent establishment in 1948 through the ethnic cleansing of more than half of the indigenous
                      people of Palestine, Israel has set out to control as much land and uproot as many Palestinians as it can.
                      As a result of this systematic forced displacement, there are now more than 7.25 million Palestinian refugees.
                      They are denied their right to return to their homes simply because they are not Jewish.

                  <section class="buffered">
                    <h4>What are Boycotts, Divestments, and Sanctions?</h4>
                    <p>
                      <span class="keyword">BOYCOTTS</span> involve withdrawing support for Israel and Israeli and international companies that are involved in the violation of Palestinian human rights, as well as complicit Israeli sporting, cultural and academic institutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <span class="keyword">DIVESTMENT</span> campaigns urge banks, local councils, churches, pension funds and universities to withdraw investments from all Israeli companies and from international companies involved in violating Palestinian rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <span class="keyword">SANCTIONS</span> campaigns pressure governments to fulfill their legal obligation to hold Israel to account including by ending military trade, free-trade agreements and expelling Israel from international forums such as the UN and FIFA.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      BDS is now a vibrant global movement made up of unions, academic associations,
                      churches and grassroots movements across the world. Eleven years since its launch,
                      BDS is having a major impact and is effectively challenging international support for
                      Israeli apartheid and settler-colonialism.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For nearly seventy years, Israel has denied Palestinians their fundamental
                      rights and has refused to comply with international law.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Israel maintains a regime of settler colonialism, apartheid and occupation over the
                      Palestinian people. This is only possible because of international support.
                      Governments fail to hold Israel to account, while corporations and institutions
                      across the world help Israel to oppress Palestinians.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Because those in power refuse to act to stop this injustice,
                      Palestinian civil society has called for a global citizens&rsquo; response of solidarity
                      with the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice, and equality.
