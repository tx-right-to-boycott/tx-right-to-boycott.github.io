  <h1>Testifying before the Texas Legislature</h1>
  <p>
    Thank you for taking the time to testify before the Texas
    legislature! Itâ€™s not an easy breezy process, but <em>do not be deterred.</em>
    The information here will help prepare you. You&rsquo;ll rock it.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can give spoken and/or written testimony at public hearings.
    You can also simply register your position on a bill without giving testimony,
    and your position will go into the public record.
  </p>

    <h3>Written vs. Oral Testimony</h3>

    <p>
        Not all committees will disseminate written testimony if you do not also
        give spoken testimony. The best way to find this out is to call the committee
        and speak to the clerk in charge of taking testimony for that committee.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you do not want to speak at a hearing but want to ensure that legislators
      receive a written testimony, you may:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Give a copy of your written testimony to the clerk for that committee.
        </li>
        <li>
          Call the offices of the legislators on the committee hearing the relevant bill,
          find out who are the legislative aides working on that bill, and send a copy of
          your testimony to each aide.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </section>

    <h3>Preparing your written statement</h3>

    <p>
      Begin your statement by addressing the committee and identifying yourself,
      if you&rsquo;re representing yourself or an organization, the bill
      you&rsquo;re testifying about, and your stance on the bill.
      For example:
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
      &ldquo;Mr. (or Madam) Chair, and members of the committee, my name is
      Awesome Dude from Austin and I&rsquo;m representing myself (or Super Cool Org)
      to testify in favor of (or in opposition to) HB/SB #.&rdquo;
    </div>

    <p>
      The rest of your statement should be a clear, direct, and concise as possible.
      Bullet point style would not be a poor choice. If you can and feel comfortable
      doing so, making your statement as personal as possible is highly encouraged.
      If you reference numbers or statistics, include a citation. You should never
      be rude or threaten any of the committee members.
    </p>

    <h3>Preparing your spoken statement</h3>

    <p>
      For most bills, you&rsquo;re allowed three minutes to speak, but for some you
      only get two. Begin your testimony by identifying yourself, who you may represent,
      and your stance on the bill. Continue with a concise, and if you wish personal
      statement about your position. If public speaking makes you nervous, it is best to
      practice a couple of times before the hearing. You might find it useful to write
      down some key points on an index card and ad-lib off those.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may be asked questions during or after your testimony, so it&rsquo;s also a
      good idea to write down some notes, statistics, citations, or even full answers to
      questions you are likely to be asked.

    <h3>How to register to give testimony</h3>
    <p>
      You can only register to testify at a public hearing on the day of the hearing.
      Witness registration opens on the day the bill is being heard at 8:00 AM.
      Usually, registration closes after the bill has been heard, but be aware
      that some committees have closed registration early this session,
      notably for SB 4 (Sanctuary Cities bill).
    </p>

    <p>
      To register, use the computer kiosks located near the public hearing room.
      Note that some public hearings take place in other buildings in the Capitol
      Complex, where there are also registration kiosks. You can also register
      from your own mobile device as long as you are connected to the Capitol&rsquo;s wifi.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see this process in action, watch
      <a href="https://www.mytxlegis.legis.state.tx.us/hwrspublic/Video/HouseWitnessReg.mp4">
        the House&rsquo;s video on how to use the kiosks.
      </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Senate registration is similar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also note that hearings for some bills have different rules. For example,
      anyone testifying for SB 6 had to fill out a paper registration card instead
      of signing up electronically. If you&rsquo;re not sure what the process is
      or have any questions about it, call the committee. If you get lost or
      confused the day off, find someone to ask, such as a security guard or
      legislative staff.

    <h3>What to expect on the day of</h3>
    <p>
      If submitting a written statement or written copies of a spoken statement,
      bring 20 copies of the document with you to the public hearing. Make sure
      your name is on each copy. The day of the hearing, bring those copies with
      and any other notes you want to have on hand with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Near the room in which the public hearing is taking place, there will be a
      kiosk of computers. You will use one of these computers to register your
      position on the bill and, if you want, sign up for testimony. If submitting
      written testimony, give copies of your statement to the committee clerk.
      You may then go on your merry way. If you decide to speak, after signing in,
      go to the hearing room or the designated overflow room and wait for your
      name to be called.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once your name is called, proceed to the hearing room. If you made copies of
      your spoken statement, hand them to the clerk (who will then give them to
      each member of the committee) then sit at the designated table and give your
      testimony. If you submit copies of your spoken statement, it is best not to
      read the statement word for word as legislators can read it themselves.
      Instead, address the key points you want to raise.
    </p>

    <p>
      When giving your testimony, you will be seated at a table in front of a
      semi-circle of committee members. There will be a microphone, stop clock,
      and buzzer on the table. When you have one minute left to speak, you will
      hear a beep. The second beep means you are out of time, at which point you
      should wrap up your statement quickly. Committee members may respond to your
      testimony with questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the exchange is supposed to be courteous and professional, it is not
      uncommon for legislators to behave in disrespectful and/or dismissive ways
      towards speakers whose viewpoints different from theirs. If this happens, stay calm.
      Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to be rattled.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not always clear how long you will have to wait to speak as this depends
      on how many bills are being considered at a hearing, the order the bills are being
      considered in, how many people have signed up to testify, and whether or not open public
      testimony on a bill is preceded by invited testimony. Bring a water bottle and snacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, it is best to dress business casual. If you are representing an organization,
      especially if you are going as a group, it is not uncommon for everyone to wear
      official T-shirts for that organization or a particular color (e.g. purple for transgender rights).

    <h3>Parking</h3>

    <p>
      Free 2-hour parking can be found in the Capitol&rsquo;s visitor parking garage on 13th
      and San Jacinto Streets. The visitor&rsquo;s garage can get full fast,
      so it&rsquo;s best to get there early. You can also use street parking
      and other garages around the Capitol.
