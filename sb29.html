    publicly available information regarding companies, including information provided by the state, nonprofit organizations, research firms, international organizations, and governmental entities.
  </p>

  <p>

    list on a publicly available website.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sec. 808.052. IDENTIFICATION OF INVESTMENT IN LISTED COMPANIES. Not later than the 30th day after the date a state governmental entity receives the list provided under Section 808.051, the state governmental entity shall notify the comptroller of the
    listed companies in which the state governmental entity owns direct holdings or indirect holdings.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sec. 808.053. ACTIONS RELATING TO LISTED COMPANY. (a) For each listed company identified under Section 808.052, the state governmental entity shall send a written notice informing the company of its status as a listed company and warning the company that
    it may become subject to divestment by state governmental entities.
  </p>

  <p>
    (b) The notice must offer the company the opportunity to clarify its Israel-related activities and must encourage the company, not later than the 90th day after the date the company receives notice under this section, to cease boycotting Israel in order
    to avoid qualifying for divestment by state governmental entities.
  </p>

  <p>
    (c) If, during the time provided by Subsection (b), the company ceases boycotting Israel, the comptroller shall remove the company from the list maintained under Section 808.051 and this chapter will no longer apply to the company unless it resumes boycotting
    Israel.
  </p>

  <p>
    (d) If, after the time provided by Subsection (b) expires, the company continues to boycott Israel, the state governmental entity shall sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities of the company, except securities described by Section
    808.055, according to the schedule provided by Section 808.054.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sec. 808.054. DIVESTMENT OF ASSETS.

  <p>
    (a) A state governmental entity required to sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities of a listed company shall comply with the following schedule:
  </p>

  <p>
    (1) at least 50 percent of those assets must be removed from the state governmental entity's assets under management not later than the 180th day after the date the company receives notice under Section 808.053 or Subsection (b) unless the state governmental
    entity determines, based on a good faith exercise of its fiduciary discretion and subject to Subdivision (2), that a later date is more prudent; and
  </p>

  <p>
    (2) 100 percent of those assets must be removed from the state governmental entity's assets under management not later than the 360th day after the date the company receives notice under Section 808.053 or Subsection (b).
  </p>

  <p>
    (b) If a company that ceased boycotting Israel after receiving notice under Section 808.053 resumes its boycott, the state governmental entity shall send a written notice to the company informing it that the state governmental entity will sell, redeem,
    divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities of the company according to the schedule in Subsection (a).
  </p>

  <p>
    (c) Except as provided by Subsection (a), a state governmental entity may delay the schedule for divestment under that subsection only to the extent that the state governmental entity determines, in the state governmental entity's good faith judgment,
    and consistent with the entity's fiduciary duty, that divestment from listed companies will likely result in a loss in value or a benchmark deviation described by Section 808.056(a). If a state governmental entity delays the schedule for divestment,
    the state governmental entity shall submit a report to the presiding officer of each house of the legislature and the attorney general stating the reasons and justification for the state governmental entity's delay in divestment from listed companies.
    The report must include documentation supporting its determination that the divestment would result in a loss in value or a benchmark deviation described by Section 808.056(a), including objective numerical estimates. The state governmental entity
    shall update the report every six months.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sec. 808.055. INVESTMENTS EXEMPTED FROM DIVESTMENT. A state governmental entity is not required to divest from any indirect holdings in actively or passively managed investment funds or private equity funds. The state governmental entity shall submit
    letters to the managers of each investment fund containing listed companies requesting that they remove those companies from the fund or create a similar actively or passively managed fund with indirect holdings devoid of listed companies. If a manager
    creates a similar fund with substantially the same management fees and same level of investment risk and anticipated return, the state governmental entity may replace all applicable investments with investments in the similar fund in a time frame
    consistent with prudent fiduciary standards but not later than the 450th day after the date the fund is created.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sec. 808.056. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENT IN LISTED COMPANIES.
  </p>

  <p>
    (a) A state governmental entity may cease divesting from one or more listed companies only if clear and convincing evidence shows that:
  </p>

  <p>
    (1) the state governmental entity has suffered or will suffer a loss in the hypothetical value of all assets under management by the state governmental entity as a result of having to divest from listed companies under this chapter; or
  </p>

  <p>
    (2) an individual portfolio that uses a benchmark-aware strategy would be subject to an aggregate expected deviation from its benchmark as a result of having to divest from listed companies under this chapter.
  </p>

  <p>
    (b) A state governmental entity may cease divesting from a listed company as provided by this section only to the extent necessary to ensure that the state governmental entity does not suffer a loss in value or deviate from its benchmark as described
    by Subsection (a).
  </p>

  <p>
    (c) Before a state governmental entity may cease divesting from a listed company under this section, the state governmental entity must provide a written report to the comptroller, the presiding officer of each house of the legislature, and the attorney
    general setting forth the reason and justification, supported by clear and convincing evidence, for deciding to cease divestment or to remain invested in a listed company.
  </p>

  <p>
    (d) The state governmental entity shall update the report required by Subsection (c) semiannually, as applicable.
  </p>
